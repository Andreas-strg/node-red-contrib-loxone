# node-red-contrib-loxone

This is a work-in-progress node to connect the Loxone Miniserver to
node-red. It uses [node-lox-ws-api](https://github.com/alladdin/node-lox-ws-api) 
by Ladislav Dokulil based on Loxone's documenation for the [Websocket API](https://www.loxone.com/dede/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/loxone-communicating-with-the-miniserver.pdf).

It enables you to connect the Loxone Miniserver directly to node-red and work with the data
on occuring events. As this uses the official Websocket, you will only see controls that are 
visualized in Loxone-Config. 

The connection to the miniserver is encrypted (hashed) via node-lox-ws-api, AES-256-CBC for command encryption 
is possible. It is kept alive via `node-lox-ws-api`.

**This is an early release, consider it as a testing/beta!**

> Help, pull requests and feedback in general are very welcome!

As I don't have an own Loxone installation, I can't do a "real world" test. 
Gladly a friend of mine lent me his spare miniserver for initial testing.

Tested with loxone-config V8.1.11.11, node-red 0.16.2, nodeJS 6.10.0 LTS

### Examples

Here's a small video with the Loxone Webinterface on the left, Loxone-Config with LiveView enabled in the 
middle and node-red with node-red-dashboard on the right: https://cloud.codm.de/nextcloud/index.php/s/hNO2hIgnGIDWGqM

Here is another example of reading the current used bandwith of a FritzBox-Router and display 
 this data in the visualisation of the Miniserver:  https://cloud.codm.de/nextcloud/index.php/s/5XoNoMLilinpU4v

### Working parts so far
* Configure a miniserver connection 
* Loxone-In node ~~(no subcontrols)~~
* Loxone-Out node ~~(no subcontrols)~~
* Loxone-In: Select a control and a state to "listen to" which then gets passed to node-red
* Loxone-Out: Select a control and feed it commands according to the [structure file](https://www.loxone.com/dede/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/loxone-structure-file.pdf?x48792)

The structure file can also be retrieved via `http://<miniserver>/data/LoxAPP3.json`.
An explanation of the file can be found [here](https://www.loxone.com/dede/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/loxone-structure-file.pdf)

**You will get the data from Loxone's websocket _as is_. There is and will be no abstraction layer!**
So please know how to handle the data according to the documentation.

The `msg.payload` holds the value retrieved from the miniserver. The `msg`-object itself holds more information of
the selected control. For example:

    {
        payload: 20.8125,
        topic: "test ds18b20",
        state: "value",
        room: "Serverraum",
        category: "Temperatur",
        details: {
            format: "%.1fÂ°"
        },
        type: "InfoOnlyAnalog"
    }
    
I've discovered that a switch element emits its current state (`active`) two times with the same value.
The first one when the trigger-button is pressed and second one when the button is released - so 
take care of this as it might give you unexpected results.
Also keep in mind, that this element sends `1/0` but expects to be fed with `On/Off/Pulse`.

~~Maybe you can point me out, how to get `I1-I8` directly via the WS-API.~~ As only visualized controls are
shown in the structure file, this won't work.

### Currently partially working, caveats

* ~~The "connected" info under the node in the editor is buggy atm~~
* On initial configuration you have to deploy first, so that the runtime can connect to the MS, in order 
to load the structure file so you can select controls
* Only `controls` are parsed, no `mediaServer`, `weatherServer`, etc. 
  Is this enough? 
* ~~No `subcontrols`, yet~~
* There's only marginal error handling for the editor


### ToDo
* Convenience / Testing!
* Connection handling on first configuration
* ~~More info in `msg`-object based on structure file~~
* ~~Configuration of the encryption method - currently only "Hash"~~
* ~~Loxone-Out~~ needs testing
* ~~SubControls~~ needs testing
* better logging, more failsaveness, more user info
* See `TODO` comments in the code
* ...
